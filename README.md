# Traveling-salesman-problem

Given a series of distance between each cities, find the route traversing all cities and back to the initial city with the minimal cost. Note that the problem is equivalent to find a Hamiltonian loop that minimizes the values of a fully-connected graph where each edges has a weight.

**Exampe:** "fri26_d.txt" from TSPLIB \
A distance matrix with 26 nodes, the minimal tour has length 937.
